         <h2>
               Curiosity, also called Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), U.S. robotic vehicle, designed to explore the surface of Mars, which determined that Mars was once capable of supporting life. The rover was launched by an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on November 26, 2011, and landed in Gale crater on Mars on August 6, 2012.
         </h2>
         <h2>
           Curiosity is about 3 metres (10 feet) long and weighs about 900 kg (2,000 pounds), which makes it the longest and heaviest rover on Mars. (By contrast, the Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, are 1.6 metres [5.2 feet] long and weigh 174 kg [384 pounds].) Unlike previous rovers, Curiosity did not have its landing cushioned by air bags; rather, because of its large size, it was lowered to the surface by three tethers from the spacecraft’s body, called the sky crane.



         </h2>
         <h2>Curiosity does not rely on solar cells for its energy needs but rather draws its electric power from a thermoelectric power generator, with the heat source being the radioactive decay of plutonium and the heat sink being Mars’s atmosphere. This internal power supply will allow Curiosity to continue operating through the Martian winter. Curiosity’s mission is planned to last one Martian year (687 Earth days).

Curiosity’s landing site, Gale crater, is at a low elevation; if Mars ever had surface water, it would have pooled there. Aeolis Mons (also called Mount Sharp), the crater’s central mountain, consists of many layers of sedimentary rock that were laid down over much of Mars’s geological history. In September 2012 Curiosity took pictures of water-transported gravel, meaning that at one time Gale crater was likely the floor of an ancient stream.

Curiosity found that early Mars could have supported life. It also found traces of organic molecules preserved in rock layers 3.5 billion years old and that the amount of methane in the Martian atmosphere varies with the seasons. As of 2020, Curiosity had traveled 21.8 km (13.5 miles) in Gale crater.

Curiosity carries several experiments that probe the Martian environment. A neutron-beam generator provided by the Russian Federal Space Agency can detect water ice down to two metres (six feet) below the surface. The Spanish Center for Astrobiology supplied Curiosity’s weather station. The largest experiment, the Sample Analysis at Mars, consists of a mass spectrometer, a gas chromatograph, and a laser spectrometer that search for carbon-containing compounds. Curiosity also has several cameras, one of which takes high-definition video at a rate of 10 frames per second.
